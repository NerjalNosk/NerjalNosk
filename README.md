<h2>My work</h2>

I work on a whole buch of stuff, whether it is DB setup, app building, website creation, network management...<br>
I also like Minecraft mod programming.

<h3>Most active projects</h3>

My most active (personal) projects lately are the following:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NerjalNosk/JsonLight"><b>JsonLight</b></a> A Java Json parsing and manipulation library, going over and beyond Json5, adding its own particular tweaks</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NerjalNosk/StringCursor"><b>StringCursor</b></a> A Java cursored text building library, which provides a headless implementation for a user interface's text input</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some future projects</h3>

Not much to say here sorry. There are a buch of projects that I intend to work on, but most are either personal or some clients' requests, so I cannot talk about it, except saying I did, it when it'll be done.

But I can still give a few projects I intend to work on:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Minecraft modding</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create new, more or less stupid mods, on the account of the <a href="https://github.com/RecraftorsMC">Recraftors Team</a></li>
      <li>Update my outdated mods, or simply keep my active ones up to date</li>
      <li>The crazy <code>Almanac</code> project I got myself on, for the Recraftors Team</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other games modding</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wait for more progress on <a href="https://lifecraft.life">Lifecraft</a> and try to add whatever dumb ideas my head may come up to</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe look into modded versions of Android apps? Idk tbh, will have to look real deep into what can be exploited out of Android and apps interaction, to make things fun</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
