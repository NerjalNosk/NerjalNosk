<h2>My work</h2>

I work on a whole buch of stuff, whether it is DB setup, app building, website creation, network management...<br>
I also like Minecraft mod programming.

<h3>Some future projects</h3>

Not much to say here sorry. There are a buch of projects that I intend to work on, but most are either personal or some clients' requests, so I cannot talk about it, except saying I did, it when it'll be done.

But I can still give a few projects I intend to work on:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Minecraft modding</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update my outdated mods, such as the not-so-little-afterall <a href="https://github.com/NerjalNosk/Conditional_keep_inventory">conditional keep inventory</a></li>
      <li>Implement <a href="https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/frostiful">Frostiful</a> compat in <a href="https://github.com/Snownee/SnowRealMagic">SnowRealMagic</a></li>
      <li>Implement <a href="https://github.com/CorgiTaco/Enhanced-Celestials">Enhanced Celestials</a> compat in <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/moonphaseinfo%2B">Moon Phase Info+</li>
      <li>Implement literally any mod compat to <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderRyb/LeaveSlabs">Leaves slabs (or just make my own version, with modded leaves support, idk)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other games modding</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wait for more progress on [Lifecraft](https://lifecraft.life) and try to add whatever dumb ideas my head may come up to</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
